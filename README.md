# \<lazy-image\>

`lazy-img` is a lazy loading img element that is shadow-dom friendly
and uses [IntersectionObserver](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/04/intersectionobserver)
to detect when images are within the viewport and need to be loaded.

Demo is based on [this example of intersection-observer](https://github.com/wilsonpage/in-sixty/blob/gh-pages/intersection-observer/index.html)
